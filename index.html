        Welcome to our renowned southern style American diner. The Smokehouse
        has been open since September 2018 and we have already established
        ourselves as the regions go-to family Smokehouse restaurant. We offer a
        fantastic range of home cooked and in-house smoked meals from burgers to
        freshly home smoked meat using our signature recipe rubs. This ensures
        that our succulent joints are packed full of flavour. We have even
        created our very own Smokehouse lager designed to compliment our varied
        menu. Our friendly and attentive serving team aim to ensure that your
        dining experience is second to none. We aim to accommodate all ages,
        tastes and do our very best to cater for any specialist dietary
        requirements. We have a wide variety of vegetarian, vegan & gluten-free
        options on our menu.
